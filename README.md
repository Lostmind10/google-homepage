# google-homepage

Introduction: This project is for me to learn how to build the Google homepage.

Reflection: I did the easy version of this assignment. It took me a long time to accomplish, but I really tried to pay attention to all the details. I think it turned out fairly well. You can view my [clone of google here](https://lostmind10.github.io/google-homepage/)
